  <h1>Color Search Demo - Steven Mlodzianoski</h1>

  <p>
    In 2019 I participated in a Hackday at Salesforce with three Data Scientists. 
    I built the UI for our Color Search project. The highlight of the UI is a sliding color bar; 
    as you slide a bar over a rainbow, the search results (of clothing) update in real time. I also 
    provided a multi-color selection palette so search results could include multiple colors. And a 
    Hackday project wouldn't be complete without a cheap "hack", so to increase speed results for 
    the demo (they didn't have time to add caching in the data model) I added localStorage caching to 
    the front-end to make the UI smooth. We won second place. Color Search was later built as an add-on 
    feature to ecomm search.
